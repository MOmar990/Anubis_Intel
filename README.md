## 📜 The Legend

In ancient Egypt, **Anubis** stood as the guardian of secrets and judge of souls - weighing hearts against the feather of truth. This platform embodies that sacred duty in the digital realm, serving as the guardian and judge of intelligence, separating truth from deception with the precision of ancient wisdom.

**Anubis Intelligence Platform** is a comprehensive intelligence report generation and management system designed for security researchers, digital forensic analysts, and intelligence professionals. The platform generates professional-grade dossiers with Intelligence Community (IC) standard formatting, complete with classification markings, biometric data integration, and advanced analytics capabilities.
